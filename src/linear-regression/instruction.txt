1. Required Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Provides various machine learning algorithms, including LinearRegression, train_test_split, and evaluation metrics.
matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization (plotting the results).
2. Steps:

Import the necessary libraries:

Import the required libraries using import statements.
Load and prepare the data:

Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Feature Selection: Select the feature (independent variable) and the target variable (dependent variable).
Data Cleaning (Optional): Handle missing values, outliers, and perform any necessary data transformations.
Split data into training and testing sets:

Use the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to divide your data into training and testing sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Create and train the model:

Create an instance of the LinearRegression class.
Train the model on the training data using the fit() method.
Make predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data using the predict() method.
Evaluate the model:

Calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the model's performance.
Visualize the results (Optional):

Use matplotlib.pyplot to create plots like scatter plots to visualize the actual vs. predicted values and understand the model's fit.
This outline provides a general framework. The specific steps and data preparation may vary depending on your dataset and the complexity of your analysis
